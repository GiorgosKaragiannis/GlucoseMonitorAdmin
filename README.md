# GlucoseMonitorAdmin

The Patient Glucose Monitor System is a full-stack web application designed to track and manage patients' blood glucose levels efficiently. The project connects a MySQL database with a Node.js and Express backend, which serves data through REST API endpoints to a dynamic frontend interface.

The application allows medical staff to view a real-time list of patients and automatically categorizes their health status based on glucose levels. Using JavaScript logic, it flags values below 70 as Hypoglycemy and above 120 as Hyperglycemy with visual indicators. Additionally, the system includes a feature to add new patient records directly through a web form, updating the database and the user interface instantly without requiring a page refresh.
